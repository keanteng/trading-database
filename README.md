To create databases for inventory management system, especially goods trading company dataset. In this project, I aim to create database and store them on SQLite using Python. The objective is to understand the flow of data in a relational database and such understanding is crucial when we are working on project such as inventory management, sales tracking and more.

The data make use of the Python [faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/) library to create fake details and information. All the data are identified by a cryptographic id to ensure no duplicates and unique.
